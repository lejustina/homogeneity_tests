# Homogeneity Tests for Complete and Censored Related Samples

This repository provides algorithms for non-parametric homogeneity tests for both complete and censored related samples. Additionally, simulated examples are presented to demonstrate the application of these tests.

## Homogeneity Tests

### For Complete Data:
1. **Sign Test** (Two-sample case)
   
2. **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test** (Two-sample case)
   
3. **Friedman Test** (More than two-sample case)

### For Censored Data:
1. **Akritas Method** (Two-sample case)

2. **Weighted Log-Rank Criterion** (Two-sample and more than two-sample cases)
   - Proposed by V. Bagdonaviƒçius

3. **PPW Test** (Two-sample case)
   - Designed for left-censored data in 'NADA2' package.
